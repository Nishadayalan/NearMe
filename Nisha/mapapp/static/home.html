Neyveli is located in virudhachalam taluk in cuddalore districtin Tamil Nadu. Near neyveli there is a small village named 
seplanatha(south) that is my home town. It is a village in kammapuram block in cuddalore district of Tamil nadu state,India. 
It is located 50 km towards west from district headquarters cuddalore. Seplanatham(south) is surrounded by neyveli block towards north,virudhachalam
block towards west, keerapalayam block towards east, melbhuvanagiri block towards east. Jayapriya theatre and mahalakshmi palace
are the nearby theatre to seplanatham. Jawahar Science College and Vivekananda polytechnic College are the colleges in seplanatham. Thermal Power
plant(neyveli) is located near seplanatham. From there electricity is provided to some other ststews like Andhra pradesh. I like my village more than any another
place.
